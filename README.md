# cse330-r
3rd Module for class using R

# Overview

The program I wrote was a simple one of cleaning and processing data files before they are used for analysis. This code is mainly for the csv I have uploaded but with a couple changes, it can work for any csv file you might have.

I wrote this software to help me understand how R works and what it can be used for. There are many different ways to analyze data with R and I am looking forward to knowing how to do that.

# Development Environment

For the module, I used VSCode to write all of my code. I used Git for version control and updating while using Github for storing my files online.

This project was pretty simple so I only used R for the language with my file being a CSV file.
