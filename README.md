3rd Module for class using R

# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the R language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

For the module, I used VSCode to write all of my code. I used Git for version control and updating while using Github for storing my files online.

This project was pretty simple so I only used R for the language with my file being a CSV file.
